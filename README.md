  <summary>Some Py code</summary>
Some of my code from 2020 MIT 6.00.1x course

And then new ways of having fun without any project in mind.

## Log of new code (desc order)

**2023-04-30**

File: [No_code_error.py](2023_py/No_code_error.py)
```
Wrote example code for raising error when function doesn't have any code.
Good for future reference when planning features in existing code that are empty for now. To raise awareness so to speak :)
